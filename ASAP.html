								<h1> ASAP: Stock Market Evidence Regarding Public Policy </h1>
							</header>
							<!-- Introduction -->
							<p>
								In April 2021, The Wall Street Journal published an article titled “The Airline Safety Revolution” (Pasztor, 2021), 
								crediting the policy of the US Federal Aviation Administration’s Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) introduced in 1997 
								towards a ‘remarkable’ reduction in the rate of fatal accidents. This program encourages voluntary reporting of safety issues for enforcement-related incentives, 
								and enhances communication between carriers in identifying potential precursors to accidents.
							</p>
							<p><b>
								This study examines the financial effect of the ASAP; or if in the aftermath of the ASAP policy, the free market tends to ‘fine’ 
								the airlines involved in the crash more than before 1997. 
							</b></p>

					To measure the economic impact of an event on a firm, financial market data can be used, assuming the markets are rational and efficient.
					To find the effect of the ASAP policy, two groups of 15 randomly chosen crashes were created to analyze and conduct an event study.
					The estimation period for the event study was taken as 120 days before each crash. The event window to analyze abnormal returns is taken to be 10 days, 
					wherein the day of the crash is taken as <i>t</i>=0. Using data from the estimation window, the Fama-French 3 factor model is used to predict 
					the values of normal returns, which would be the case if the crash being studied did not happen. To estimate the coefficients, a linear regression was used.
					For more information regarding the Fama-French 3 factor model, this <i><b><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/famaandfrenchthreefactormodel.asp"> link </a></b></i> may be useful.

					Using the estimated coefficients, we can predict the estimated normal values for each of the stock, and use the actual returns data to find abnormal returns.

							Graph 1 - Abnormal Returns for Pre-ASAP and Post-ASAP Crash Groups
						</div>
					</div>
					<p></p>
					Upon running the regression and finding abnormal returns, the results obtained for the pre-ASAP period show on only slight negative effects of the air disasters. 
					This is surprising and in direct contention with results of previous papers. For the post-ASAP period, the negative effects are slightly bigger. <b>Both the graphs have negative troughs 
					at day 3 and day 8,
					and these negative returns for those days are quickly counteracted by increased buying pressure due to the price drop, further suggesting that the market does not believe the crashes to have any long term
					effect on the stock price and performance of these companies. </b>
					<p></p>
					<p>					
						We can see this further by analyzing a heatmap of just the actual returns of the stocks. 
					</p>

							Graph 2 - Heatmap of Actual Returns
						</div>
					</div>
					<p></p><b>
					From this heatmap, we can see that the returns in the event period (closer to the top of each column) appear almost as random as the rest of the stock prices. This is in line with the findings
					here, that the market seems to downplay the effect of the crash and recovers quickly, as also seen in graph 1. </b>

		<!-- Conclusion -->
		<div class="concl">
			<div class="concl_text">
					This is the first study that tackles how the ASAP, and in turn, the use of enforcement-related incentives affects the capital markets and shareholders.
					However, the inconclusiveness of the test conducted here, especially being in contrast to previous air crash studies, points to areas which should further be explored to understand public perception of policy regarding regulations or the lack thereof. 
					For a larger study, it could be possible to take into account all the accidents that have happened in the US in the two time periods. With such a sample, 
					concrete evidence could be produced in support of or against the ASAP. The randomness seen in the returns figure also points to a knowledge gap in what causes changes in the public perception of accidents. 
					While the number of fatalities seems to be at least somewhat connected, it could also be important to see how shareholders attribute the fault of a disaster to the airlines itself, or another 
					entity, such as the manufacturer.

								<h1> Efficiency of the Vancouver ER System </h1>
							</header>
							<!-- Introduction -->
							<p>
								 After rushing to the ER on the 26th of June, '22 with an upset stomach and a high fever, I was told to take a seat. This wait extended for 4 hours, watching other
								 people join me in what was a quickly crowding room, as nurses rushed to handle all of the patients. The waiting time displayed showed other emergency rooms that seemed to have
								 lower waiting times. This interaction at the ER provided me the basis for this study. 
							</p>
							<p>
								 This analysis examines the inefficiencies faced by the Vancouver ER System. As a disclaimer, when in need of an ER, it is imperative that any individual go to one that is closest.
								 This study only aims to highlight how better to allocate resources, and ER are equipped to prioritise patients on the basis of needs. An implicit assumption of this analysis is that
								 all patients are dealing with needs that hold the same priority, and that all the hospitals are equally equipped to handle these needs.

					The wait times for ERs all over Vancouver are available to the public <i><a href="http://www.edwaittimes.ca/WaitTimes.aspx">here</a></i>. The data is scraped from this site, and using 
					time taken to travel
					between the hospitals from Google Distance Matrix API, we can find if it'd be beneficial for the incremental patient to be transferred to a different hospital. Using this idea of 
					<i>efficient transfers</i>, we can find transfers between which hospitals would be beneficial in reducing overall wait times.
					<p></p>
					<p> The following figure shows the efficient transfers in blue. As can be seen, there are a lot of efficient transfers that can take place.</p>

		<!-- Conclusion -->
		<div class="concl">
			<div class="concl_text">
					If all the transfers calculated by the above figure are to be executed, the total reduction in wait times would be about 76 hours. This is an incredibly large number, which only serves to frame 
					the large impact inefficiency can have. It can also relieve some of the pressure the healthcare system places on the staff at the busiest of these locations. 
					<p></p>
					Most importantly, this highlights how important it can be to check wait times before heading to an emergency room. While no system for transferring ER patients between hospitals exists, unless
					required on the basis of medical expertise, individuals in need of an ER who can afford to take themselves to a different ER than the one closest can often find themselves not only
					helping the stressed healthcare staff and reducing their own wait times, but also the wait times of all Vancouver residents who might be in need.

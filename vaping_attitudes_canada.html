								<h1> Changes in Perceptions of E-Cigarette Use of Teenagers </h1>
							</header>
							<!-- Introduction -->
							<p>
								According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021), most e-cigarettes 
								contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and can harm adolescent brain development.
								To truly combat the harm that e-cigarettes can cause the youth, I believe it is important to supplement regulations with a 
								proper understanding of the risks posed to the youth. Targeted education can be a keystone in decreasing e-cigarette use.
							</p>
							<p><b>
								This paper tackles the question of how a school’s location in an urban or rural area affects its students’ perception of e-cigarette use in
								Canada.

					To answer this question, the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey 2018/2019 is used. 
					Measuring risk perception can shed light on future e-cigarette use, as supported by Vogel et al. (2021),
					according to whom higher risk perceptions are associated with a lower likelihood of e-cigarette use. By taking 
					into account the student’s current smoking status, their sex at birth, and their grade, we use regression analysis to explore this dataset.
					<p></p>
					The secondary data analysis for this study is based on CSTADS 2018/2019, sponsored by Health Canada and conducted by
					Statistics Canada. The respondents are students in Canadian schools, from grades 7 to 12. The
					total sample for this survey is 62,850 individuals. As outlined later, the students who responded
					“I do not know” to the perceived risk of e-cigarette use have been excluded. Further, 79
					observations were removed due to missing values for whether the school belonged to an urban or
					rural region, and so the number of samples studied is 55,218.

					These covariates as well as the treatment variable are explained in the following summary table:

					<b>For ease of interpretation, positive values mean that the factor contributes to a more risky
					perception of e-cigarette use. With these results, we can see that in both regressions, students
					attending school in rural areas tend to perceive occasional e-cigarette smoking as less risky
					compared to those attending school in urban areas. These results are also statistically significant with p-values less than 0.05.</b>
					<p></p>
					<p>					
						We can see this more easily in a comparitive graph between urban areas and rural areas as shown below:

					<p></p>
					<b>From this graph, we can see that a higher percentage of students perceive e-cigarette use as less risky in rural areas as compared to urban areas. Also, the perceived risk 
					tends to reduce as the student’s go to upper classes in their highschools.

		<!-- Conclusion -->
		<div class="concl">
			<div class="concl_text">
					The CSTADS is a large cross-sectional survey and using it, we can decisively say that students
					studying in rural areas have a higher likelihood of e-cigarette use, associated with their lower risk
					perceptions. With the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes, it is of utmost importance that public
					health professionals understand where to best allocate resources to have the biggest impact. As
					such, this study provides a look at tackling this problem. It should be noted that trends among
					groups should be tracked closely in order to effectively address the rising popularity of
					e-cigarette use as new regulations continue to be passed.
